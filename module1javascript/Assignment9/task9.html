<!--Write a program that asks the user for an integer and tells if the number is a prime number. -->
<!--Prime numbers are numbers that are only divisible by 1 and itself.-->
<!--For example, number 13 is a prime number as it can only be divided by 1 or 13 so that the result is an integer.-->
<!--On the other hand, number 21 for example is not a prime number as it can be also be divided by numbers 3 and 7.-->
<!--Print the result on the HTML document.-->
